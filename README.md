*the adventure continues..*

*o*ats on the homerow is something i kinda stumbled upon and have adored since. maybe its my autism speaking but i really like oats irl so i was like, okay this *has* to stay if i can help it. its been an interesting design challenge to say the least. 

i did some looking into the commonality of english characters and did my best to keep the least used characters out of the way. the most used are on the home row, and with the middle and index fingers, one key above and below respectfully, as i find it easiest to move these fingers up/down compared to my other digits. 

before updating "*o*ats", i kinda went on a sidequest and explored the possibilities of alpha characters on the thumbs by way of ["Mycelium"](https://github.com/rowie324/Mycelium). i got a little bit carried away and came up with a layout that i thought was good, until some people on the reddits pointed out than the layout analyzer i was using did not take thumb SFBs into account. However! i do think "Mycelium" was a worthwhile experiment if nothing else.

so finally, here i am back at what is for me, a comfortable home in "*o*ats".
